Your `isPathCrossed` function seems to be checking whether a path crosses itself. It works by moving along the path defined by a sequence of distances in four directions (up, left, down, right) and checking if the current position has been visited before.

Let's break down the function:

1. Initialize variables: `x` and `y` represent the current position, `visited` is a set to store visited positions, `directions` holds the four possible directions, and `direction` keeps track of the current direction.

2. Iterate over the distances provided. For each distance:
   a. Move in the current direction for the specified distance.
   b. Check if the current position has been visited before. If so, return `True`, indicating that the path has crossed itself.
   c. Add the current position to the visited set.
   d. Update the direction to the next one in the sequence.

3. If the loop completes without finding any crossing, return `False`.

Your test case `[2, 1, 1, 2]` specifies a path that goes 2 units up, 1 unit left, 1 unit down, and finally 2 units right, forming a loop without crossing itself. Therefore, the expected output is `False`, indicating that the path does not cross itself.

Your function looks correct!
